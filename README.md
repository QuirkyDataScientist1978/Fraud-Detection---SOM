# Fraud-Detection---SOM
Self organizing maps to predict which customers in a bank are potentially fraud. Udemy -Deep Learnin A-Z

We are given a dataset with informations of customers from a bank applying for an advanced credit card. These informations are the data that customers had to provide when filling the application form. Our goal is to detect potential fraud within these applications.

At the end, we need to give a list of the customers who potentially cheated.

We will achieve this with unsupervised deep learning, which means that we will identify some patterns in a high dimensional dataset full of non-linear relationships and one of these patterns will be the potential frauds.

The dataset includes the customer ID and all the other variables asked in the application form. The dataset doesn't make sense without the self-organizing map

After creating the map, the list is provided, in which the first column refers to the customer ID which can potentiallu be fraud
